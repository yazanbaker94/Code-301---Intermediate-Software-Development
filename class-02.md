# Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
##  render

# What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
##  Mounting
### When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

# Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

##  constructor
##  render
##  React Updates
##  componentDidMount
##  componentWillUnmount


# What does componentDidMount do?
##  componentDidMount()
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().


# What types of things can you pass in the props?
##  What Are Props? Props (aka "properties") in React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.


# What is the big difference between props and state?
## Basically, the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters.

# When do we re-render our application?
##  React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically.

# What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

##  state, store, static, and this
